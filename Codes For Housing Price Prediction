##The pairplot above reveals that is a statistically significant positive
correlation between the size of the residential properties and their respective market prices with larger homes being more expensive than smaller homes.
Their is a direct increase in price for increase in area. Furthermore, the distribution of home prices exhibits a pronounced right skewness indicating 
a higher frequency lower-priced properties with a gradual tapering towards higher values.While majority of the properties fall within a certain price range, 
there are outliers with significantly higher prices contributing to the rightward skew.##

##In the violin plot above we can see that from 0.2 to 0.8 (USD millions) that out data has a significant bulge suggesting that there is large amount of obeservations in that range. 
The long tail extending past approximately 1 to 1.4 million USD indicates the presence of outliers in our data.##
